The Intermission Menu is where you will be sent between stages. This menu allows you to view and upgrade pilots and mechs, equip parts to mechs, set up the deployment for the next stage, swap pilots around, change game options, save or load the game and proceed to the next stage.

### Pilot and Mech list

### Upgrade Mech

Upgrade the stats of your mechs. If a mech is upgraded enough you will unlock its Full Upgrade Bonus.

### Equip Parts

Equip parts you have collected to your mechs. These parts will give your mechs certain bonuses or can be consumables that restore HP, EN or SP. Consumables can only be used once per stage but are returned after the end of the stage if used.

### Upgrade Pilot

Upgrade the stats of your pilots and teach them new abilities. PP(Pilot Points) are required. Pilots gain PP by shooting down enemies. PP is not shared between pilots.

### Deployment Window

The deployment window is available from the intermission menu. It can be used to set up which units will be deployed on the next map. The deployment window can also be shown at the start of the stage. The changes made during the intermission will be present in the on-map version so you only need to set up deploys for the next stage once.
