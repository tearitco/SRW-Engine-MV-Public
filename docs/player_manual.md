## The Deployment window

The deployment window is available from the intermission menu. It can be used to set up which units will be deployed on the next map. The deployment window can also be shown at the start of the stage. The changes made during the intermission will be present in the on-map version so you only need to set up deploys for the next stage once.

In the deployment window certain slots may be locked, indicated by a lock icon. These slots are for units that will take part in events on the next map and can not be changed.

### Controls

* Arrows: Select a unit
* Z/Cross: Swap units around
* X/Circle: Cancel swapping a unit, return to the main menu

* Page down/R1: Move the current unit to the back, shifting the other units in the list
